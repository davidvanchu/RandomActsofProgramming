OS X Application Fall 2015

Presents a fake login screen to the user.

Images (background and icon) are tailored to my personal icon and background choice.

Intended use: Joke application to display a fake login screen to the user. Any password is accepted, so user can mash the keyboard and then press enter, making it seem like they memorized a crazy password that involves mashing the keyboard.

Nothing is recorded.
